# Sales Taxes App Testing Guide

The Sales Taxes App is designed to calculate the receipt details for shopping baskets based on specific tax rules. Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
